### Service
In my professional service I review for [the American Sociological Review and Criminology](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0955-1031), and have served as an Editorial Assistant for Sociological Perspectives. My service to UC Irvine includes work as a Peer Mentor and Graduate Representative for the Criminology, Law & Society department, and as a Graduate Representative to the School of Social Ecology. In my service to the community, I provide statistics tutoring for inmates at California State Prison Solano, consult with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and work with the Federal Defenders of the 1st Circuit.


### Prior Experience and Interests
Before academia, I built models and developed strategies for technology and infrastructure companies as a consultant and data analyst. I earned my bachelors in 2014 at Harvard - with a major in [Social Studies](https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/) and minor in Psychology - and wrote a senior thesis on how police and gun owners idealized gun ownership. 

Outside of work, I enjoy culinary experiments (like creating my own [beef jerky recipe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g3BNcLFfN2xKgDRqwK4-0S1jt4SJRSaw_OR_8raQ0g/edit?usp=sharing)), being active, and the challenge of mastering progressive metal drum parts.
