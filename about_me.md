## About me
Candidate at UC Irvine's [Criminology, Law & Society](https://cls.soceco.uci.edu/pages/phd-program) PhD! Recipient of the [National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research Dissertation Award](https://www.ncgvr.org/grants/2022/assessing-the-causes-of-gun-desirability-in-america.html) to evaluate policy and social theory. I am a research team member of the [Shadow Costs](www.shadowcosts.com) project on monetary sanctions (funded by NSF, RSF, and Haynes grants), and a member of the [Irvine Laboratory for the Study of Space and Crime](http://ilssc.soceco.uci.edu/).

My service to the discipline includes work as an Editorial Assistant for Sociological Perspectives and reviewer for [Criminology](https://publons.com/researcher/3682904/justin-sola/). My service to UC Irvine includes work as a Peer Mentor and Graduate Representative for the Criminology, Law & Society department, and as a Graduate Representative to the School of Social Ecology. My service to the community includes statistics tutoring for persons incarcerated at California State Prison Solano, consultation with the ACLU, and expert analysis of US gun ownership.

Before academia, I built models and conducted research for tech, reinsurance, and infrastructure companies as a consultant and then data analyst in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I graduated from Harvard in 2014 with honors in [social studies](https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/), a minor in psychology, and a senior thesis on US gun ownership (see section below).  Outside of study I like building computers, reading science fiction, making beef jerky ([my personal recipe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g3BNcLFfN2xKgDRqwK4-0S1jt4SJRSaw_OR_8raQ0g/edit?usp=sharing)), puns, and learning progressive metal drum set parts (working on some [Tesseract](https://www.tesseractband.co.uk/) songs).

## Gun ownership research beginnings

In the summer of 2012 I decided to research US gun ownership. Two discrepancies catalyzed my interest:

**First**, I noticed a disconnect between how gun owners thought about legitimate force, and how theorists, like Weber, argue that a modern state had a “monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force” within its territory. US gun owners often view their gun ownership as both 1) in competition with the state monopoly of force and 2) complementary with state power by ensuring personal safety and enforcing norms (e.g. the aphorism that 'an armed society is a polite society').

**Second**, I felt that there wasn't enough sociological research on US gun ownership; most studies were concerned with outcomes, like David Hemenway’s seminal statistical analyses, rather than the mechanisms, motives, and preconditions of gun ownership. As Randall Collins said about the study of US gun ownership:
>It is not a sociological explanation of behavior to invoke the reasons given, especially on occasions of public justification and debate .... Instead we should ask, 'Why do particular people come to believe in these reasons, or rather, in what circumstances do they invoke them .... What is it that possessors of guns do?' – Interaction Ritual Chains (2004, p. 100)

For my thesis I conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 gun owners and police from Vermont and Massachusetts. I sought to understand how participants believed responsibility for welfare and security should be divided among individuals, families, communities, and governments. I coded these beliefs and narratives, comparing participants' beliefs with both their gun ownership practices (such as guns owned and concealed carry behavior) and their gun control stances.
