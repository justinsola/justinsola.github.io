## About me
5th year PhD candidate at UC Irvine's [Criminology, Law & Society](https://cls.soceco.uci.edu/pages/phd-program). My accolades include being named a 2023-24 Haynes Dissertation Fellow, receiving the 2022-23 [National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research Dissertation Award](https://www.ncgvr.org/grants/2022/assessing-the-causes-of-gun-desirability-in-america.html), and being named a 2018-23 Arnie Binder Fellow. My work focuses on the [Shadow Costs](https://www.shadowcosts.com) project, which tests the impact of rehabilitation classes and monetary sanctions (with funding by NSF, NIJ, RSF, and Haynes grants). Additionally, I am an active member of the [Irvine Laboratory for the Study of Space and Crime](http://ilssc.soceco.uci.edu/).

## Service
In my professional service, I review for [Criminology](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0955-1031) and have served as an Editorial Assistant for Sociological Perspectives. My service to UC Irvine includes work as a Peer Mentor and Graduate Representative for the Criminology, Law & Society department, and as a Graduate Representative to the School of Social Ecology. In my service to the community, I provide statistics tutoring for inmates at California State Prison Solano, consult with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and work with the Federal Defenders of the 1st Circuit.

## Prior Experience and interests
Before my transition into academia, II built models and conducted research for a variety of sectors - including technology, reinsurance, and infrastructure - initially as a consultant, then as a data analyst, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I earned my undergraduate degree in 2014 from Harvard University in [Social Studies](https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/), with a minor in Psychology and a notable senior thesis on U.S. gun ownership (see <a href="./gun_research_origins">Why Study Guns?</a>).

Outside the realm of academics and work, I enjoy culinary experiments, such as creating my own [beef jerky recipe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g3BNcLFfN2xKgDRqwK4-0S1jt4SJRSaw_OR_8raQ0g/edit?usp=sharing). I also have an affinity for puns and the challenge of mastering progressive metal drum parts, with current endeavors including pieces by Tesseract.
