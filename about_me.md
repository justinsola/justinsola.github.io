## About me
4th year candidate at UC Irvine's [Criminology, Law & Society](https://cls.soceco.uci.edu/pages/phd-program) PhD! I serve as an Editorial Assistant for <i>[Sociological Perspectives](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/spx)</i>, am a member of <i>[Irvine Laboratory for the Study of Space and Crime](http://ilssc.soceco.uci.edu/)</i>, serve as Graduate Representative to the School of Social Ecology, and previously served as Graduate Representative for the Criminology, Law & Society department.

Before UCI, I built models and conducted research for tech, reinsurance, and infrastructure companies as a consultant and data analyst in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I graduated from Harvard in 2014 with honors in [social studies](https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/), a minor in psychology, and a senior thesis on US gun ownership (see section below).  Outside of study I like building computers, reading science fiction, making beef jerky ([my personal recipe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g3BNcLFfN2xKgDRqwK4-0S1jt4SJRSaw_OR_8raQ0g/edit?usp=sharing)), puns, playing drum set (working on some [Tesseract](https://www.tesseractband.co.uk/) songs), and making [pretty histograms](https://github.com/justinsola/justinsola.github.com/tree/master/code).

## Gun ownership research beginnings

Two discrepancies catalyzed my interest in US gun ownership research during the fall of 2012:

**First**, I noted a disconnect between how gun owners thought about legitimate force and how social theorists, like Max Weber, argue that a modern state had a “monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force” within its territory. But US gun owners often view their gun ownership as both 1) in competition with the state monopoly of force and 2) complementary with state power by ensuring personal safety and enforcing norms (e.g. 'an armed society is a polite society').

**Second**, I felt that there wasn't enough sociological research on US gun ownership; most studies were concerned with outcomes, like David Hemenway’s seminal statistical analyses, rather than the mechanisms and motives of gun ownership. As Randall Collins said about the study of US gun ownership:
>It is not a sociological explanation of behavior to invoke the reasons given, especially on occasions of public justification and debate .... Instead we should ask, 'Why do particular people come to believe in these reasons, or rather, in what circumstances do they invoke them .... What is it that possessors of guns do?' – Interaction Ritual Chains (2004, p. 100)

For my thesis I conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 gun owners and police from Vermont and Massachusetts. I sought to understand how participants believed responsibility for welfare and security should be divided among individuals, families, communities, and governments. I coded these beliefs and narratives, comparing participants' beliefs with both their gun ownership practices (such as guns owned and concealed carry behavior) and their gun control stances.
