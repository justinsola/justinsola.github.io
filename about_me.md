## About me
Candidate at UC Irvine's [Criminology, Law & Society](https://cls.soceco.uci.edu/pages/phd-program) PhD! 2023-24 Haynes Dissertation Fellow and recipient of the [National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research Dissertation Award](https://www.ncgvr.org/grants/2022/assessing-the-causes-of-gun-desirability-in-america.html) to evaluate policy and social theory. I work on the [Shadow Costs](https://www.shadowcosts.com) project on monetary sanctions (funded by NSF, RSF, and Haynes grants), and a member of the [Irvine Laboratory for the Study of Space and Crime](http://ilssc.soceco.uci.edu/).

### Service
My service includes work as an Editorial Assistant for Sociological Perspectives and reviewing for [Criminology](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0955-1031). My service to UC Irvine includes work as a Peer Mentor and Graduate Representative for the Criminology, Law & Society department, and as a Graduate Representative to the School of Social Ecology. My service to the community includes statistics tutoring for persons incarcerated at California State Prison Solano, consultation with the ACLU, and expert analysis of US gun ownership for the 1st Circuit's Federal Defenders.

### Before academia
Before academia, I built models and conducted research for tech, reinsurance, and infrastructure companies as a consultant and then data analyst in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I graduated from Harvard in 2014 with honors in [social studies](https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/), a minor in psychology, and a senior thesis on US gun ownership (see <a href="./gun_research_origins">Why Study Guns?</a>).  Outside of study I like making beef jerky ([my personal recipe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g3BNcLFfN2xKgDRqwK4-0S1jt4SJRSaw_OR_8raQ0g/edit?usp=sharing)), puns, and learning progressive metal drum set parts (working on some [Tesseract](https://www.tesseractband.co.uk/) songs).
