I research gun ownership and how the criminal justice system interacts with inequality. I use preregistered experiments (forced-choice conjoint and vignette), longitudinal designs (smartphone-delivered surveys), semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and content analysis techniques like topic modeling.

My active projects include:
1.  Evaluating the [Shadow Costs](https://www.shadowcosts.com/) of treatment programs
2.  Investigating how socioeconomic hardship affects desire for guns
3.  Critiquing causal theories of neoliberalism
4.  Assessing how gun ownership affects neighborhood socialization
