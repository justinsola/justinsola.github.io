- <a href="./files/2021.05.16%20Sola%20-%20Transmitting%20Desire%20preprint.pdf">**Sola, Justin L**.  Accepted (preprint) 2021</a>. Transmitting Desire: An Experiment on a Novel Measure of Gun Desirability in a Pandemic. *Sociological Perspectives Special Issue â€“ The Coronavirus (COVID-19) & Society*.

## Research orientation

My research interests are 1) the generation & maintenance of socioeconomic inequality and 2) testing theories of how and why people seek security. I actively research 1) gun desirability, 2) how carceral contact affects inequality, 3) heterogeneity in desire for police service, 4) the epistemology of mixed-methods social research, and 5) how Americans consume security through training, equipment, and group membership.

I use both qual and quant methods, employing a variety of research designs including experimental, survey, and participant observations in conjunction with interviews. I want to conduct research that is rigorous, respects actors' frames of action, and that imputes adequate motives and mechanisms of behavior (to paraphrase Peter Bearman).
