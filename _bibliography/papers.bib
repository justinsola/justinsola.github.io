  abstract = {There is little scholarship about what affects calls for service, even as they originate the vast majority of police interventions in the USA. How do racial perceptions, ambiguous situational contexts, and participant demographics affect desire to call the police? With a large preregistered survey experiment, we find that perceived race does not directly affect mean desire to call the police or perceived threat. However, political views moderate the effects of race: compared to politically moderate participants, very liberal participants express less desire to call the police while very conservative participants express more desire to call the police in a vignette featuring young Black men.},

  abstract = {Research on punishment and inequality finds that people with criminal records routinely avoid systems of surveillance, but . Yet scholarship on monetary sanctions shows that many are enmeshed with the state in other ways. How can these literatures be resolved? Drawing on nationally representative survey data, as well as unique data collected on people with monetary sanctions in seven states, we find that individuals and families receiving cash and noncash public assistance are significantly more likely to owe monetary sanctions and are less likely to pay them. We discuss the implications of multiple-system involvement for ongoing surveillance.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and protests have marked an unprecedented increase in U.S. gun sales. Can I use this increase to validate gun desirability as a measure so that scholars and policymakers can test theories and plans? With a large preregistered survey experiment, I find gun desirability is a valid measure of inclination toward gun ownership, and that a pandemic video vignette significantly increases overall gun desirability relative to a control video vignette. These results serve as a foundation for future scholarship to (1) discern gun desirability trends, (2) evaluate theorized causes of gun desirability, and (3) consider interventions on those conditions that arouse desire for gun ownership.},
