  authors={Sola, Justin L. and Charis E. Kubrin.},
  abstract={How do racial perceptions, ambiguous situational contexts, and participant demographics affect desire to call the police?

  With a large preregistered survey experiment, we find that perceived race does not directly affect mean desire to call the police or perceived threat. However, political views moderate the effects of race: compared to politically moderate participants, very liberal participants express less desire to call the police while very conservative participants express more desire to call the police in a vignette featuring young Black men.},

  Reviewing multiple theories and sources of data, we find that severe and chronic employment struggles often predate and follow incarceration. We provide a detailed discussion of policy reform proposals that could help to remedy this harmful dynamic.},

  Drawing on nationally representative survey data, as well as unique data collected on people with monetary sanctions in seven states, we find that individuals and families receiving cash and noncash public assistance are significantly more likely to owe monetary sanctions and are less likely to pay them. We discuss the implications of multiple-system involvement for ongoing surveillance.},

  authors={Sola, Justin L.},
  abstract = {Can a measure of gun desirability help scholars and policy makers?

  With a large preregistered survey experiment, I find gun desirability is a valid measure of inclination toward gun ownership, and that a pandemic video vignette significantly increases overall gun desirability relative to a control video vignette. These results serve as a foundation for future scholarship to (1) discern gun desirability trends, (2) evaluate theorized causes of gun desirability, and (3) consider interventions on those conditions that arouse desire for gun ownership.},
